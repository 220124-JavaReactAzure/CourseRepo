# Microsoft Azure

**Azure** a subsidiary of Microsoft that provides on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to individuals, companies, and governments, on a metered pay-as-you-go basis.

In this example, we will cover a brief overview and demo to connect to **Azure RDS**.

## Azure RDS:

RDS is a Database as a Service (DBaaS) that automatically configures and maintains your databases in the Azure cloud. The user has limited power over specific configurations in comparison to running PostgreSQL directly on Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2). RDS is a convenient service, as long as the offered instances and configurations meet the user's needs.

### DB Instances:

The basic building block of Azure RDS is the **DB instance**. A DB instance is an isolated database environment in the Azure Cloud.

-   Your DB instance can contain multiple user-created databases.
-   You can access your DB instance by using the same tools and applications that you use with a standalone database instance.
-   Create a DB instance using either the **Azure Management Console** or Command Line Interface.

Each DB instance runs on a **DB engine**. Azure RDS currently supports the MySQL, MariaDB, **PostgreSQL**, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server DB engines.
